Task-1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

the function uses recursion as the basis of calculating the factorial
in the definition of factorial we know that also 0! = 1 
using that as the base case i made the function call itself after multiplying n by factorial(n-1) and reassigning it to n.


Task-2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

first i imported the math module.
then i took the input(n) from the user and converted it to integer as input is always taken as string.
then using f string i wrote the statement for square root, used the value of input(n) and used math.sqrt(n) which is a function that returns the square root of the argument given to it.
similarly i wrote for natural log and sin. ( math.log(n) and math.sin(n) )
